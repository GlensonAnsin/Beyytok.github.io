                <div class="about-paragraph">
                  <p>But I am also known as Bea, Yang or Bey. I am currently a freshman student at <br>
                    The University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. Born on <br>
                    February 04, 2003, I am the oldest of four siblings. My family and I are currently <br>
                    residing here in Purok 3, San Martin, Villanueva, Misamis Oriental. <br>
                    <br>
                    My educational objectives are to continue my education, to graduate as an IT <br>
                    student, and to use technology to help others. Also, my career goal is to become <br>
                    a professional programmer and to work on a team with other programmers. This <br>
                    will enable me to hone my skills while also teaching others who are interested <br>
                    in learning more about programming. If not, I want to be someone who is passionate <br>
                    of whatever job I end up having in the future.</p>

                  talk to him like he's a baby while petting him, especially when he's scared. He may be tough <br>
                  when it comes to strangers, but he gets scared easily with noises. The second oldest is Bella, <br>
                  she is quite playful, yet a little bit spoiled but still a sweetie. Most of the times she acts <br>
                  like a child. The youngest is Pua. Both Bella and her play at times, but not her and Sammy. <br>
                  Sammy would fight her. Pua is a very energetic and playful labrador. If you play with her, it <br>
                  would cost all your strength to do so. It's almost like she never gets tired. Our dogs may have <br>
                  different personalities, but I love them equally.</strong></p>
